# Sunshine
Sunshine provides 5 days of forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API.  Location, units, and weather notifications can be set in the settings activity.

This app was developed while I was working through the Developing Android App's course on Udacity.  Tasks that were required to develop this app included connecting to the internet, working with RecyclerViews, storing data in SQLite databases, creating a ContentProvider class to access the data, running a FireBase JobDispatchers to schedule updating the data, and utilizing SharedPreferences to store user preferences.  Starter code was provided and the course required several assignments to complete the app.
