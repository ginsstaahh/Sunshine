# Sunshine
Sunshine provides 5 days of forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API.  Location, units, and weather notifications can be set in the settings activity.

This app was developed while I was working through the Developing Android App's course on Udacity.  Tasks that were required to develop this app included connecting to the internet, working with RecyclerViews, storing data in SQLite databases, creating a ContentProvider class, running FireBase jobs in the background, and utilizing SharedPreferences.  Starter code was provided and the course provided step by step assignments to complete the app.
